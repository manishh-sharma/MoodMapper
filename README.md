# MoodMapper: Mapping Emotions using CNN

MoodMapper is a project aimed at detecting and mapping emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging the power of deep learning, MoodMapper can accurately recognize various facial expressions and infer the corresponding emotions.

## Installation:

Ensure the following packages are installed in your Python environment:
- numpy
- opencv-python
- keras
- tensorflow
- pillow

You can install them using pip: pip install numpy opencv-python keras tensorflow pillow

## Dataset:

Download the FER2013 dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) and place it in the 'data' folder under your project directory.

## Dataset:

Download the FER2013 dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) and place it in the 'data' folder under your project directory.

## Training:

To train the emotion detector, execute the following command:
python TrainEmotionDetector.py

Upon completion of training, the trained model structure and weights will be stored in the project directory as `emotion_model.json` and `emotion_model.h5` respectively. Move these files to the 'model' folder within your project directory.

## Testing:

Run the emotion detection test file with the following command:
python TestEmotionDetector.py


## Results:

MoodMapper utilizes the trained CNN model to accurately detect facial expressions and map them to corresponding emotions. It provides a robust solution for emotion recognition tasks, opening avenues for various applications such as sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and affective computing.

Explore the potential of MoodMapper in understanding and interpreting human emotions effectively!
